			<h2>A short bio</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
					Originally, Jane Richardson was a regular young girl until her parents were murdered by a dangerous maniac called Jeff The Killer, leaving her alone to work her hardest to earn money so she can survive and look after her only alive relative, her sister Jessie. But a few years later, something sinister would happen. Turned out that for a long time the government were trying to invent a weapon to track and take down Jeff. This weapon was the mysterious serum called "Liquid Hate" that, under right circumstances, would turn a human being into a walking death machine. Unfortunately, or fortunately, this serum was injected into Jane's body without her permission, which turned her into a very powerful human being, gaining a big number of supernatural abilities like inhuman strength, reaction, agility, perfect vision with ability to see in complete darkness and mimicry. Now, after what have happened to her, her only mission is to kill Jeff and subsequently avenge her family's demise.

			<h2>Personality</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
				While being a character of a creepypasta story, Jane is actually not the bad type of a character. In fact, she is quite the opposite. It can be discovered by both her actions and her behaviour. Even after turned into Jane The Killer, she is still the same Jane Richardson, who is kind to everyone who she considers dear, like Jessie, her sister, for example, and who is trying to help those in need. She still remains the girl she was, keeping her good qualities that make her stand out of most creepypasta characters. Although, while being a good type of character, she becomes comparatively more evil if provoked or annoyed, and even more so if she sees someone who she may consider "worthy of her judgement". Fortunately, she behaves and acts so only towards those who truly deserve it.

			<h2>Appearance</h2>
			<hr>
			<p>
				Before turning into Jane The Killer, Jane Richardson had a blonde hair and blue eyes, as well as naturally pitched skin, but after a transformation once blonde hair turned into cold black and blue eyes became nothing but a void. She is usually depicted wearing black dress and high heels, although there is no strong canon about how she dresses, as she could be dressing whatever is suitable for her current task.

			<h2>Some facts about her</h2>
			<hr>
			<ul>
				<li>
					There exist two versions of this character - Jane Everlasting and Jane Arkensaw. Jane Everlasting is considered to be a true Jane The Killer.
				</li>
				<li>
					While looking really dangerous and scary, she still remains the girl she was before the transformation, and tries her best to look after Jessie, but if annoyed or provoked, she becomes ruthless and often uncontrollable.
				</li>
				<li>She is often depicted to be using a knife as her main weapon.</li>
				<li>
					Unlike other famous creepypasta characters, Jane The Killer is unique due to her not being a serial killer and actually being the opposite - she tracks them down and kills them, although that does make her a killer, but more of a vigilante type.
				</li>
				<li>An original creator claimed that Jane Richardson is canonically a lesbian.</li>
