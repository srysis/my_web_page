		<p>
			My name is Denis. I am a twenty-one year old guy who wants to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript so I can become a web-developer and turn into a full-time job.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering since I wanted to be a programmer, but as time went on I realized that advanced programming is not my passion, so I decided to develop myself in Front-End, even though I liked programming.
		</p>
		<p>
			I see myself as some sort of designer, maybe not neccessarily a "direct" designer, but the type of guy to implement a design that was set by someone else. I may present my own designs, but for now I'd like to be an implementer, and an implementer in form of web-page at that.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have a passion for modelling and animating. I may not be very good, but by the time I was practicing it, I learned a lot of things about visual clarity, simplicity and general principles that make a picture look good. But even though I really like working with 3D-graphics, I often find myself burning out and not wanting to do it at all, so I decided to not make it a full-time job, otherwise it would be hard for me to enjoy the thing I once really enjoyed.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also have an experience with game engines, specifically with Unity. I made a short game as my graduation project, that had one linear level, three types of enemies, and pretty simple combat/movement system. It taught me a lot about code and project management too, as well as modelling and animating basics. I passed the graduation with B mark, so I am happy about that, although the game was clearly not really polished, but playable still and didn't have a lot of bugs.
		</p>
		<p>
			That's pretty much it about me. I hope you found this short bio at least remotely interesting. Feel free to explore the rest of the web-site. Enjoy your stay.
