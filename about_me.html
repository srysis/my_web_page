			Hello! This is the extended version of my personal web-site. <br>
			It contains more personal information about me as a person, as well as my interests and a bit of life stories. <br>
			It also contains some pages about things that I really enjoy. <br>
			Consider this being my personal blog. Enjoy your reading!

		<h3>About me:</h3>
		<p>
			My name is Denis, I go by nickname "srysis". I am a twenty-one year old guy who wants to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript so I can become a web-developer and turn into a full-time job.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering since I wanted to be a programmer, but as time went on I realized that advanced programming is not my passion, so I decided to develop myself in Front-End, even though I liked programming. My favorite languages were C-family programming languages, but my first ever programming language was PASCAL. I like C-family languages for their strict and more apparent code. I don't really like Python. While it is relatively easy to start programming on Python, I often find myself being confused by it's statements and constructions.
			Eventually I stopped learning programming and focused more on expressing my creativity in a more obvious way.
		</p>
		<p>
			I mostly play games in free time. My favorite genre is action, if to be specific <abbr title="First-person shooter">FPS</abbr>. I don't play too many games these days, but the ones I really enjoy include:
			<ul>
				<li><del>Team Fortress 2</del></li>
				<li>Warhammer: Vermintide 2</li>
				<li><del>Don't Starve Together</del></li>
				<li>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</li>
				<li>Fallout 76</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			I've played more games through my lifespan, but these three are the main ones for me right now. Because I don't have a job yet and don't have any hobbies, I play very often. I hope this will change some day.
		</p>
		<p>
			I rarely watch movies. Probably because I am not really excited about sitting in one place for almost two hours straight, but if I had to pick ones that I really like, these will be:
			<ul>
				<li>Addams Family(1991 and 1993)</li>
				<li>Charlie and the Chocolate Factory</li>
				<li>Firestarter</li>
				<li>Green Mile</li>
				<li>Forrest Gump</li>
				<li>Shawshank's Redemption</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			I like to listen to music from time to time. I am mostly into alternative rock and symphonic/gothic metal(I am not sure which name is appropriate), but I also appreciate some OG gothic rock bands. I won't go into much detail about how my music tastes were formed, but I will say is that it all started from Marilyn Manson, who is a pretty much legendary(to me, at least) artist. Until I started actively listening to his music, I was mostly limited by games' OSTs. After that I started discovering some really cool bands, that I still listen to from time to time. While some bands/artists are considered very basic and maybe even unoriginal by today's standards, you can't stop me from enjoying them. The list of my current favorite bands are listed below:
			<ul>
				<li>Marilyn Manson</li>
				<li>Motionless in White</li>
				<li>Evanescence</li>
				<li>Lacuna Coil</li>
				<li>My Chemical Romance</li>
				<li><abbr title="His Imperial Majesty">HIM</abbr></li>
				<li>Bauhaus</li>
				<li>Siouxsie and The Banshees</li>
				<li>Sisters of Mercy</li>
				<li>The Cure</li>
				<li>Ladytron(electronic music, used to listen to this band a lot)</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			I would like to expand my horizons to more bands from same genres. I've recently discovered a band named Elysion, which is a symphonic/gothic metal band. They sound pretty cool, but I need more research and give it more tries. I would also like to discover more gothic rock artists. I've listened to Christian Death, but I have mixed feeling about this band yet, perhaps it will change one day.

			I really like modelling and animating, but I consider it a hobby and not a job. I am pretty familiar and comfortable with Blender. I made a game on Unity Engine as my graduation project. 
			It's a game about a girl fighting undead mobs, the test level was an abandoned graveyard, where skeletons would start appearing from their graves and attack the girl. 
			There was also a necromancer guy, who would summon skeletons after noticing her. My inspiration were two games that I both consider the best and unique in that regard - first-person shooter Painkiller and action-platformer Alice: Madness Returns; first game inspired me for level design, while the second one - main protagonist and combat/movement system. I really enjoyed making it and I wanted to continue to improve it after the graduation, but time was short and other matters were at hand, so project sees no development for now. <em>But maybe some day...</em><br>
			If you, by some chance, want to try it out, you can download the last playable build using <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DLWaHVPh_8DpjDflodhaRjixQjnl7w5z/view?usp=drive_link" target="_blank"><em>this</em></a> link, though I am not sure why you would want to do that. Keep in mind, that it is not very polished, so expect some bugs.

			For a long time in my life, I was using a program called <abbr title="Source Filmmaker">SFM</abbr>. It's an animating/posing tool that allows users to create their own 3D-artworks with assets from different games, made by Valve Corporation, more specifically Team Fortress 2. However, it also allows using of custom assets made by it's community of artists that are being distrubuted on platform called Steam Workshop for free. Using Source Filmmaker made me want to learn how models and textures are being made, so I even made my own version of certain character. You can see it on the right side of this paragraph(soon.). I liked how she turned out, although my life situation highly affected this character, so she was not the hero, but neither she was a villain. She was more of an anti-hero archetype.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are a certain list of characters that pretty much defined my tastes and preferences. There is not too much of them, but I really like and appreaciate them. These are:
			<ul>
				<li><a href="alice.html">Alice Liddell</a>, American McGee's version</li>
				<li><a href="willow.html">Willow</a> from Don't Starve</li>
				<li><a href="pandemonica.html">Pandemonica</a> from Helltaker</li>
				<li><a href="jane.html">Jane</a> from "Jane The Killer" creepypasta</li>
			</ul>
		</p>

			That's pretty much it about me. I hope you found this short bio at least remotely interesting. Feel free to explore the rest of the web-site. Enjoy your stay.
