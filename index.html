			Welcome to my web-site. On this site I test my skills as well as develop a small portfolio for future employers. <br>
			It will improve over time and more content will appear. <br>
			This page contains only general information. The more elaborate version can be found <a href="about_me.html"><em>here</em></a> or by the link in the header (sidebar menu, if you are on mobile version) of this page.

		<h3>About me:</h3>
		<p>
			My name is Denis. I am a twenty-two year old guy who wants to learn HTML, CSS and JavaScript so I can become a web-developer and turn into a full-time job.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have a bachelor's degree in Software Engineering since I wanted to be a programmer, but as time went on I realized that advanced programming is not my passion, so I decided to develop myself in Front-End, even though I liked programming and still do as an occasional activity.
		</p>
		<p>
			I have a passion for modelling and animating. I may not be very good, but by the time I was practicing it, I learned a lot of things about visual clarity, simplicity and general principles that make a picture look good. But even though I really like working with 3D-graphics, I often find myself burning out and not wanting to do it at all, so I decided to not make it a full-time job, otherwise it would be hard for me to enjoy the thing I once really enjoyed.
		</p>
		<p>
			I also have an experience with game engines, specifically with Unity. I made a short game as my graduation project, that had one linear level, three types of enemies, and pretty simple combat and movement mechanics. It taught me a lot about code and project management, as well as modelling and animating basics.
		</p>
		<p>
			That's pretty much all you need to know about my professional life.
